# Project status
This framework is being developed alongside a game. Once the game is production 
ready this framework will be considered beta.

Right now we are still making breaking changes, so this should be considered an
alpha release for people who are interested in tracking the development of this
project. We do not recommend using this for writing production games yet.

# Development environment

You need to have webpack installed.

# Production build
To build this package run this command:

```bash
npx webpack
```

This will update `main.js` in the `dist` folder with a minified version of the Javascript.
