# Configuration
Before you can do anything else with the Frag framework, you
must construct an instance of the [`Engine` class](reference/engine.md).
When you construct an `Engine` you can optionally pass a configuration
object to configure the framework. Please refer to the
[`Engine` class documentation](reference/engine.md) for more details.
